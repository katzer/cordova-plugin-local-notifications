## Important notice
1. Its been a while that the plugin has received major updates and bug fixes. My (free)time is limited and I have multiple projects to maintain. Once I've updated my background-mode plugin the local-notification plugin will get an official release supporting ios10. The ios10 branch will be merged into the master as well.

2. For the future I am looking for other opportunities to support and enhance the plugin. That might be a crowdfunding campain or adding other core maintainers. Everyone with an serious interest is welcome to contact me!

3. I am aware of the growing number of open issues and pull. Therefore, there's a new ticket template that can be found [here][ticket_template]. For every new issue please add an filled template. That will help rwillett and me to faster response to your issue. If you ignore this template, we'll ignore your issue.

Thanks for using my plugin and for your support!</br>

Cordova Local-Notification Plugin
=================================

The essential purpose of local notifications is to enable an application to inform its users that it has something for them — for example, a message or an upcoming appointment — when the application isn’t running in the foreground.<br>
They are scheduled by an application and delivered on the same device.

<img width="35%" align="right" hspace="19" vspace="12" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/example/images/android.png"></img>

### How they appear to the user
Users see notifications in the following ways:
- Displaying an alert or banner
- Badging the app’s icon
- Playing a sound


### Examples of Notification Usage
Local notifications are ideally suited for applications with time-based behaviors, such as calendar and to-do list applications. Applications that run in the background for the limited period allowed by iOS might also find local notifications useful.<br>
For example, applications that depend on servers for messages or data can poll their servers for incoming items while running in the background; if a message is ready to view or an update is ready to download, they can then present a local notification immediately to inform their users.


## Supported Platforms
The current 0.8 branch supports the following platforms:
- __iOS__ _(>= 8)_<br>
- __Android__ _(SDK >=7)_
- __Windows 8.1__ _(added with v0.8.2)_
- __Windows Phone 8.1__ _(added with v0.8.2)_
- __Windows 10__ _(added with v0.8.3)_

Find out more informations [here][wiki_platforms] in our wiki.


## Installation
The plugin is installable from source and available on Cordova Plugin Registry and PhoneGap Build.

Find out more informations [here][wiki_installation] in our wiki.


## I want to get a quick overview
All wiki pages contain samples, but for a quick overview the sample section may be the fastest way.

Find out more informations [here][wiki_samples] in our wiki.


## I want to get a deep overview
The plugin supports scheduling local notifications in various ways with a single interface. It also allows you to update, clear or cancel them. There are different interfaces to query for local notifications and a complete set of events to hook into the life cycle of local notifications.

Find out more about how to schedule single, multiple, delayed or repeating local notifications [here][wiki_schedule].<br>
Informations about events like _click_ or _trigger_ can be found [here][wiki_events].

To get a deep overview we recommend to read about all the topics in our [wiki][wiki] and try out the [Kitchen Sink App][wiki_kitchensink]


## I want to see the plugin in action
The plugin offers a kitchen sink sample app. Check out the cordova project and run the app directly from your command line or preferred IDE.

Find out more informations [here][wiki_kitchensink] in our wiki.


## What's new
We are proud to announce our newest release version 0.8.x. Beside the hard work at the office and at the weekends it contains a lot of goodies, new features and easy to use APIs.

Find out more informations [here][wiki_changelog] in our wiki.


## Sample
The sample demonstrates how to schedule a local notification which repeats every week. The listener will be called when the user has clicked on the local notification.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    id: 1,
    title: "Production Jour fixe",
    text: "Duration 1h",
    firstAt: monday_9_am,
    every: "week",
    sound: "file://sounds/reminder.mp3",
    icon: "http://icons.com/?cal_id=1",
    data: { meetingId:"123#fg8" }
});

cordova.plugins.notification.local.on("click", function (notification) {
    joinMeeting(notification.data.meetingId);
});
```
